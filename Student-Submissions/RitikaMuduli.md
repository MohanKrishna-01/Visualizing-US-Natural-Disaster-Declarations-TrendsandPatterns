### Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations: Trends and Patterns
#### Description
The Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations: Trends and Patterns project analyzes FEMA disaster declaration data to understand the occurrence and impact of natural disasters across the United States. It focuses on studying how disaster declarations change over time, vary across different states, and differ by incident type, using data analysis and visualization techniques to clearly communicate patterns and insights. It:
* Analyzes historical FEMA disaster declaration data
* Identifies temporal trends in natural disasters over the years
* Examines geographical distribution of disasters across US states
* Studies the frequency and types of disaster incidents
* Uses charts, graphs, and maps for clear data visualization
* Summarizes insights to make disaster data easy to understand
